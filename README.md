## Overview

Group 11 final project for Software Engineering at the University of MIssouri - Columbia. The goal of our project was to recreate LinkedIn to the best of our abilities within a small team of five individuals. We had to heavily focus on requirements management, since we would eventually be unable to recreate the vast majority of the features LinkedIn offers, and instead focus on the core features we would like to implement. We would continue to design and begin developing our code through 4 weekly sprints, gathering quick feedback from our instructors. Finally, what we have here is a very rough prototype of our project.

## Setup

#### Step 1 ####
+ We ask that you first setup a LAMP stack on a dedicated server. You can find out more about how to set up a LAMP stack at this great [DigitalOcean Article](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu)
+ In our case we used [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) as a service for hosting our Ubuntu machine during development. There are other options for cloud computing such as [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) or [AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/). 

#### Step 2 ####
+ Either download a ZIP of our Repo, or use GIT command line to bring all of the files to your machine. 

#### Step 3 ####
+ Import the tables defined in the DDL of the project to provide the necessary table structure.

## Privacy

While the current system does encrypt your registration password and does not publicly show your email address on your profile, we still highly recommend to not use your real name, email address, and/or your commonly used password(s) when registering for our service. We cannot guarantee a high level of security, due to the early stages of development. Thank you for your understanding.
